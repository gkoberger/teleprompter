This will let you turn any Dropbox Paper doc into a teleprompter. You can control it from a computer, and view it on an iPad.

If you see this and want to use it, create an Issue and I can fix the code up a bit so anyone can use it :)

You'll need an `.env` file that contains:

```
DB_USER=...
DB_PASS=...
DB_URL=...
```
