# Connection Demo

You'll want to run this locally using `node index.js`. It shows how to connect to the teleprompter, and react to commands.

There's only one demo command included, the ECamm Live connector. Other things you can do are control lights, slides, etc.

Feel free to add more cool examples here :)
