# Connection Demo

You'll want to run this locally using `node index.js`. It shows how to connect to the teleprompter, and react to commands.

To trigger it, put `[action:value]` in any paragraph. For example, `[slide:10]`.

There's only one demo command included, the ECamm Live connector. Other things you can do are control lights, slides, etc.

Feel free to add more cool examples here :)
